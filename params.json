Providing an affordable open source hardware/software solution to detect, report and analyze earth sky phenomena.\r\n\r\n## SkyScan Phase 1 Objectives, getting started:\r\n\r\n* Build the legacy solution as defined by Skysentinel build guide using provided Windows binaries\r\n* Build Linux binaries from the available C and Python source code.\r\n* Deploy legacy solution\r\n\r\n## SkyScan Phase 2 Objectives, explore redesign and integration using emerging technologies:\r\n\r\n* Aurduino based prototying sensors (IR, thermal, magnetometor, spectrometers, etc...)\r\n* Embeded chip based image processing and detection\r\n* Rasberry Pi computers for remote installations\r\n* Autoguide pointing of cameras for increased magnification  \r\n* IoT (Internet of Things) ready IPv6 connection  \r\n* Alternative power sources (solar, wind, etc...)  \r\n* Use of decentralized data storage and computing (MaidSafe, BOINC, etc...)   \r\n* Agregation and modeling with divergent big data sources for analysis \r\n\r\n## The Legacy System:\r\n\r\nSandia National Laboratories developed an all sky camera system intended to monitor, track, and analyze atmospheric meteor events in order to provide a \"ground-truth\" database for assisting satellite operators in separating natural and man-made events and for instrument calibration tasks.\r\n  \r\n## The legacy program objectives included: \r\n\r\n* field a network of uplooking, wide-angle view cameras at a number of sites throughout the continental United States and other countries\r\n* develop the network to access/archive data and make the data available for processing and analysis by interested parties,\r\n* develop software tools for calibration, removal of detector effects and anomalies, automatic event detection and correlation among stations, and automatic trajectory computation, and \r\n* develop a companion multi-band detector for the all-sky sensors to improve the diagnostic capability of the camera network.\r\n         \r\nNew Mexico State University's Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Las Cruces, NM, established the current network under a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE). That work has now been transfered to Space Coast Intelligent Solutions (SCIS) Melbourne, FL as part of an informal technology transfer plan and is now known as SKYSENTINEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Legacy Meteor Tracking System References:\r\n\r\nhttp://goskysentinel.com/docs/skysentinel_guide.pdf\r\nhttp://skysentinel.nmsu.edu/allsky/\r\nhttp://astronomy.sierracollege.edu/department/MeteorCamera/fb-paper.htm\r\nhttp://skysentinel.nmsu.edu/allsky/docs/skysentinel_guide.pdf\r\nhttp://skysentinel.nmsu.edu/allsky/docs/allsky_camera_build_guide.pdf\r\n  \r\n## List of Installations and Equipment Configurations\r\n\r\nhttp://allsky.ca/NAdatabase.html#notes\r\nhttp://allsky.ca/NAdatabase.html\r\nhttp://meteor.uwo.ca/~weryk/asgard/links.html\r\nhttp://meteor.uwo.ca/~weryk/asgard/intro.html\r\nhttp://cams.seti.org\r\nhttp://cams.seti.org/singlecamera.html\r\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/EZCAP-TV-116-VHS-to-DVD-Converter-XP-Vista-Windows-7-8-/200623434994?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2eb616acf2\r\nhttp://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov\r\nhttp://homepage.usask.ca/~ges125/fireball/\r\n\r\n## IFO Sources\r\n\r\nhttp://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/  \r\nhttp://spaceweather.com/flybys/flybys.php?zip=33129  \r\n\r\n## Related/Similar Projects in various stages of development/deployment\r\n  \r\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/project-heimdal-find-a-fallen-star#technicalspecs  \r\nhttp://hackaday.com/2012/03/16/automated-sky-tracking-to-catch-ufos/  \r\n  \r\n## SkyScan Project Sponsors:\r\n \r\nhttp://www.floridaMUFON.org   \r\nhttp://ufocoin.co   \r\nhttp://CEFnow.org  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
